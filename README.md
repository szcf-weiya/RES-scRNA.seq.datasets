## Results for fork from https://github.com/hemberg-lab/scRNA.seq.datasets

**Since I cannot push the results into a fork repo via LFS (refer to https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/1906), then I create current repo to store the results, `scater-objects`.**

After configuring the environment as in https://github.com/szcf-weiya/scRNA.seq.datasets/issues/1, run 

```bash
$ ./run.sh
```

to obtain the results in `scater-objects`
